# CS-410-Software-Reverse-Engineering
Software Reverse Engineering using Assembly
During this class, we explored how a computer interprets our code, we specifically looked at converting  C++ code into binary and assembly to understand better what the computer itself was doing. with that we looked specifically at the binary and assembly source files and would reverse them into what their code would be if it were made in c++.
